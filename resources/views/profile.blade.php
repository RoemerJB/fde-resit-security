    <h2 class="">A bit about myself</h2>
    <article class="">
        <p class="description">I'm Roemer, a 21 year old student with no clue what to do in life. Originally from Amsterdam, I now live at a campus in Vlissingen since last year.<br>
            I moved there because of my previous programme: the combo of nursing and midwifery. Before that I actually did one other programme, back in Amsterdam,<br>
            which was Communication &#38 Multimedia Design. In my free time I love to read, I draw a lot and sometimes I can just relax to some good music <br>
            and not know half a day passed by. <br>
            I have two cats, one named Eddie (the red one), and one named Sammie (the fat one).</p>
