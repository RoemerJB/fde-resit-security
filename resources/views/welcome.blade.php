    <h3>Why HBO suits me</h3>
    <p>I think HBO suits me because you work a lot independently, which I like. <br>
    That and it's more practical than uni, so you actually get practical knowledge instead of only theory.</p>
    <h3>Why this programme?</h3>
    <p>I've always liked working with computers, and after my first programme getting in depth <br>
        with webdesign I knew I wanted to do more. I chose this specific programme because of it's broad possibilities <br>
        and interesting courses. So far I'm really interested in what we're learning in computer science, and I can't <br>
        wait for the second block when we start to go into game development.</p>
